AntiScamer Screen Share Monitor is a Chromium and Opera extension that detects when a webpage initiates WebRTC calls or requests screen-sharing access.

It monitors:
• navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()
• navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()
• Creation of RTCPeerConnection
• SDP offer/answer exchange
• Actual activation of screen sharing by the user

The purpose is to protect users from financial scammers who trick people into sharing their screen in order to steal money (fake bank security departments, fake investment advisors, etc).

The extension:
— Does NOT capture screen content
— Does NOT process audio/video streams
— Does NOT transmit or store personal data
— Only logs the fact that WebRTC/screen-share API was invoked

When such an event is detected, the extension sends a notification to the user’s personal Telegram bot using a stored chat_id. All data is stored locally via chrome.storage. No external servers are used.
